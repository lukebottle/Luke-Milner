                        <span>Fast forward, strand... initially, I was impressed, but keep in mind, I am a hunter main. This new subclass can create a new layer of platforming. You're given the tools to area control through area navigation, which sounds backwards, but every subclass falls to kill fast, control the area, and survive. Strand opens the door to instead, relocate, kill, relocate. That's the initial subjection of strand done, as the story progressed, of which  I was playing on legendary, strand became this beautiful annoyance that I wasn't prepared for. We are thrown into arenas fighting harder enemies with new tools (skill issue).</span>
                        <span>The issue with strand, as mentioned, I played through as a hunter, I feel the grappling hook has potential, however, maybe Bungie could create a new form of ability use, let me explain myself.</span>
                        <span>The cooldown of the grapple (after the campaign is way too long), I understand it's a grenade replacement, however, it might be wise to implement a non-lethal usage, if the user grapples without following with a punch refund the grapple within 10 seconds (might even be too long). If the user grapples with a follow-up punch, maybe refund the grapple but add a cooldown for the punch. Grappling without damage is as effective as a standard movement (with style) since the grapple speed isn't exactly fast. Also, worth mentioning, the grapple completely replaces the grenade, to me, the grapple does not hold its own in this trade-off. I can now, grapple with something (which I hope to god is the right location) and now I am waiting on a long-ass cooldown to let me go again.</span>
                        <span>Now, the throwing dagger things... they're not bad, I appreciate the skill ceiling that the whole subclass offers. If you're on top of it, you can reduce the cooldown of the daggers by catching them. The animation is fluent for the daggers too, which is a positive, but this is destiny's bread and butter. </span> 
                        <span>The supper. Oh boy isn't it super. The final boss of the campaign was melted by constantly left clicks whilst in this super (still on legendary).</span>

But in a service game, the cliff hanger happens and everyone just pretends something more important is happening elsewhere in the world.</span>
                    Now let's summarise, the campaign was great, I felt the world creation was delivered perfectly. The only problem was the ending, Imagine this, Thanos gets all the infinity stones and just walks off with them... same energy.
